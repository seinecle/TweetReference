            <p>I am applying for a position for which I need to provide references.</p>
            <p>Why not ask the people I interact on Twitter for references? After all, many of them know more about aspects of my work than colleagues I see everyday in real life.</p>
            <p>This web app provides the way to <b>give and receive</b> references from Twitter users, not just for me but everybody. In the format of 140 characters max of course!
            </p>
            <p>Use it and send me feedback at @seinecle. Oh, and help me get this job, write a nice reference for me!</p>
